Hey Cardfighters!

Ever wanted to put your favorite unit on your Imaginary Gift? Your waifu? Your favorite meme? Your mom?

Well, now you can do that, and more, with k4kirin's Imaginary Gift Maker!

You can use this simple(?) tool to create your own original Imaginary Gifts! All you need is a photo or two, and you're set!

Make any type of gift in English or Japanese!

==Instructions==

'''Type: '''Choose which type of Gift you want. Both I and II are supported!

'''Language: '''English or Japanese

'''Additional options:'''

'''Top border and Bottom border: '''You may have the borders be on top of the image, behind it, or not have it at all! The "Behind image" is particularly useful if you upload a picture with transparency, so you can have the image slightly covering the border as if it were coming out of it, as almost all the official gifts do.

'''Card text: '''Similarly, you may choose to have the borderless text or not at all. I did not give the option to have the text behind an image because I don't see the point of covering such already small text. Unfortunately, having bordered text is not supported, because I can't find a good source image for them.

'''Upload image in front:''' This is the main part! Upload any kind of image here, and it will be displayed in your gift. If "Behind image" options are chosen, they will be stacked behind this image. However, if the image is not transparent, being behind the image will simply make it disappear.

'''Upload image behind: '''If you chose to upload an image with transparency in the front image, you can upload another image to act as a background. This image will appear behind the borders even if you chose the "Behind image" optoin.

'''Rotate upload: '''Press this button to rotate the image 90 degrees counterclockwise. This is useful for uploading images to make Gift II's.

'''Rotate result: '''Rotate the resulting image 90 degrees counterclockwise. This will also affect how the picture appears when you save, so press this button if you want to show off your Gift II's!

'''Refresh: '''Due to the limitations of the tools in the language I used to make this page, as well as the limitations of my brain for choosing such tools and not having the patience, often times your image will not be loaded properly the first time you upload your photo or try out new settings. Simply press refresh, and it'll be alright!

'''Save:''' This button will refresh for you if you haven't already. Afterwards, it will redirect you to the image alone, so that mobile phone users may save the image. For people on PC, I believe you don't even have to press this button; you can simply save the displayed image as you would save any image on a webpage. Just be sure to refresh first.


And that's it! I hope you all have fun making your favorite custom gifts!
